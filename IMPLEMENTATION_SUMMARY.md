Dashboard (/)
├── Projects (/projects)
│   └── Project Detail (/projects/:id)
│       ├── Team (/projects/:id/team)
│       ├── Risks (/projects/:id/risks)
│       ├── Versions (/projects/:id/versions)
│       └── Export (/projects/:id/export)
├── Templates (/templates)
├── Analytics (/analytics)
├── AI Features (/ai)
├── Compliance (/compliance)
├── Audit Trail (/audit)
├── Integrations (/integrations)
└── Settings (/settings)
```

### Consistent Patterns
1. **Back buttons** in top-left corner
2. **Action buttons** in top-right corner
3. **Card-based layouts** for content
4. **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
5. **Loading states** for async operations
6. **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
